    <p>Commonly known as CSKA or CSKA Sofia (internationally), PFC CSKA Sofia is a Bulgarian association football club based in Sofia, which for most of its existence competed in A Football Group, the top division of the Bulgarian football league system. CSKA is abbreviation for Central Sports Club of the Army. The club was officially founded in 1948, even though its roots date back to an army officers' club founded in 1923. At present, however, the club is privately owned and does not have any direct ties to the Bulgarian Army.
CSKA is the most successful Bulgarian team both domestically and internationally, and is also the most successful "army" club with domestic titles to years in existence ratio of 2.1. Since the reorganization and the merger of several Sofia-based clubs to form CSKA in 1948, the club has won 31 domestic titles and 19 national cups.[1][2] Internationally, CSKA has reached two European Cup semi-finals, four European Cup quarter-finals, and one Cup Winners' Cup semi-final, also making it the best performing Bulgarian club in the European club competitions.</p>
